# Build settings
permalink: /item/:title/ # Default permalink for item URLS. This is free to be customized, but for your items to appear in the main library, the **filename** must still be the item's unique identifier (we recommend including it in the YAML frontmatter with the 'item:' and the 'redirect_from: /item/itemID' line as well)
paginate: 9 # Number of items to be shown per pagination page.
paginate_path: /page:num/ # Pagination page path (by default it is /page1, /page2, etc.).

author: false # Set this to true if you'd like to enable displaying authors on items in this collection. By default, there is no set author displayed on item pages. This is disabled by default because most archived items don't actually require an author, but some (e.g., news), could benefit from the option.
